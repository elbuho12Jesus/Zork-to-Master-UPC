``Fighting:``
    `Occupants of the dungeon will, as a rule, fight back when attacked.In some cases, they may` 
    `attack even if unprovoked.Useful verbs here are 'ATTACK <villain> WITH <weapon>', 'KILL',` 
    `etc.Knife - throwing may or may not be useful.You have a fighting strength which varies ` 
    `with time.Being in a fight, getting killed, and being injured all lower this strength.` 
    `Strength is regained with time.Thus, it is not a good idea to fight someone immediately`
    `after being killed.Other details should become apparent after a few melees or deaths.`
