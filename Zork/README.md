## Fighting:
 Occupants of the dungeon will, as a rule, fight back when attacked.In some cases, they may 
 attack even if unprovoked.Useful verbs here are `ATTACK <villain> WITH <weapon>`, `KILL`, 
 etc.Knife - throwing may or may not be useful.You have a fighting strength which varies  
 with time.Being in a fight, getting killed, and being injured all lower this strength. 
 Strength is regained with time.Thus, it is not a good idea to fight someone immediately
 after being killed.Other details should become apparent after a few melees or deaths.
